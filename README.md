# clients
Demo Web Application

- Clone the source code from the GIT repository.
- Import the project into an IDE (I used Eclipse for the development).
- Run ClientApplication.java as a Java Application from the IDE (I used Spring Boot so it can be run as a standalone application).
- The application can be checked at http://localhost:8080/ in a web browser.
